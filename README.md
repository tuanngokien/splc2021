# [SPLC2021 Challenge Case]
# Variability Fault Localization: A Benchmark

Software fault localization is one of the most expensive, tedious, and time-consuming activities in program debugging. This activity becomes even much more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to the variability of failures in SPL systems. These unexpected behaviors are caused by variability faults which can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. Although localizing bugs in non-configurable code has been investigated in-depth, variability fault localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. To approach this challenge, we propose a benchmark for variability fault localization with a large set of 1,773 buggy versions of six SPL systems and baseline variability fault localization performance results. Our hope is to engage the community and stimulate new and better approaches to the problem of variability fault localization in SPL systems.

## Dataset
We collected 6 Java SPL systems in [SPL2Go](http://spl2go.cs.ovgu.de/), which are widely used in the existing studies about configurable code, to construct our dataset. In addition, the products of each system are composed by [FeatureHouse](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/apel/fh/), a popular automated software composer. Full dataset of configurable systems with test suites and failure reports can be retrieved from the download links.

#### Version 1 - Updated at 2021-03-05

This dataset contains 1,773 buggy versions collected from 6 Java SPL systems. 
The V1 description detail can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qknDzvqoZXUktkYogbJoJgbdjvfkfsfT/view?usp=sharing).
We later found that some cases that were not valid and should be removed. Hence, the dataset V2 is recommended.

#### Version 2 - Updated at 2021-05-04

This dataset contains 1,570 buggy versions collected from 6 Java SPL systems, statistics are summarized in the table below.

<sup>#SP, #IF stand for size of sampled products and number of involving features, respectively. </sup>

## Baseline results
To construct baseline results, we conducted experiments with the naive adaption of Spectrum-Based
Fault Localization (SBFL), which considers the whole SPL system as a non-configurable code. The suspiciousness score of a statement is measured based on the tests counted from all the products. We use this adaption with different SBFL metrics to evaluate the baseline performance on localizing variability bugs in both single-bug and multiple-bug settings.

Experimental results can be found in related dataset.

**NOTE**

- Each variant folder is labeled based on its corresponding configuration file.
- A variant name in different versions of the same system is composed by the same configuration files, which is located in [configs/] folder of Original System
- Program spectra files are aggregated directly from test execution data ([passed/] and [failed/]) in the same product. They are used as input to SBFL technique to locating buggy statements.
- To run the unit tests for a product, participant need to compile source code with Java 8 and include all custom dependencies in [lib/], Junit, and Evosuite jar files.

### *Feature Remapping
For remapping purposes, the link  between each code statement in a product and the corresponding statement in the feature is recorded.
